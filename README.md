# credit-union-member-analysis
## Project Overview
This project analyzes patterns in credit union member data to identify opportunities for service improvement and member retention. Using SQL and Python, I clean, analyze, and visualize member transaction patterns.
## Business Problem
Credit unions need to understand member behavior to offer personalized services and improve retention rates. This analysis focuses on identifying:
- Member transaction patterns
- Service utilization rates
- Opportunities for cross-selling
## Data Sources
This project uses synthetic/anonymized credit union transaction data, structured to mimic real-world scenarios while preserving privacy.
## Methodology
1. Data extraction from SQL database
2. Data cleaning and preprocessing with Python
3. Exploratory data analysis
4. Visualization of key metrics
5. Recommendations based on findings
## Technologies Used
- SQL for data extraction
- Python (Pandas, NumPy) for data manipulation
- Matplotlib/Seaborn for visualization
- Jupyter Notebooks for documentation
## Results & Insights
(To be added as project progresses)
## Future Improvements
- Implement predictive models for member churn
- Create interactive dashboard for real-time monitoring
- Integrate with additional data sources
## Running This Project
Instructions for setting up the environment and running the analysis will be added as the project develops.
